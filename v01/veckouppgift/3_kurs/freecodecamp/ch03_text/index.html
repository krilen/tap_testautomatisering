    Semantic: Giving meaning...
    In this case different hX gives meaning to the differnt topics
    
    In HTML th spaces dont matter: whitespaces collaps

    Different elements
        * Block level elements
        They ALWAYS start on a new line (creates space around it)
        Does not allow it to be put inside an elemet without the creating of a new line
        ex: hX, p, ...

        * Inline level elements
        Allows to be put inside an element without changing the spacing around it
        ex: em, strong, span, abbr, address, ...

        (abbr - abbreviation tag, needs attribute 'title' to be usedful)
        (address - address tag to handle sematic meaning of a an address
                    helping a screen readers that this is an address)
    
    Styling is done by CSS while the different inline tags are used for sematic or 
    anything other that needs to know that it has a meaning.

    HTML entities: Not the normal text that we type out
        * &nbsp; - no breaking space
        * &lt; - less then, <
        * &copy; - copy trademark, Â©
        * &gt; - greater then, >
