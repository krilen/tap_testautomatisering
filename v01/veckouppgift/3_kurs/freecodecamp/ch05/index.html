        The a tag is the ancor tag but without the href attribute it does nothing.

         * A absolute refrence it the full address: https://www...com
         * A relative refrence is when we link to something on the same server (site)
           like a picture, another html page or some other local resource.
         * A internal refrence is when you link to a specific part of the page. This
           can be used both by the absolute, relative or the page iteself.
           But to do this you need to specify the parts with the section tag with
           the attribute id. 
           After the section you need to create a navigational area using the nav tag.
           
            <nav>
                <a href="#<section_id>"><text></a>
            </nav>
            ...
            <section id="<section_id>">
                ...
            </section>
           
           All of these tags are all used to provide sematic help for the page

           If you only add a # to the href in the ancor tag you automatically gets
           a back to the top link
           ex: <a href="#">Back to top</a>

        Good practices, pointers about a link
         * Avoid putting the full link as the text of a link
         * Or use text like "this links to ..." in some way
         * Keep the link text as short as possible, topic no sentences
         * Skip the click here text 'To...<a href="...">click here</a>!'


        Attributes to a link:
         * download ('href="..." download>...</a>')
           Makes the link to be used for downloadning and not as a link. Instead of
           navigation to the refrence you download it.
         * mailto ('href="mailto:<email>"...')
           This will open up the users email client to send an email to the address.
           But this should be avoided because of the spiders the collects them for spam.
           Use a contact form instead.
         * tel ('href="tel:<phonenr>"...')
           Dail the phone number.
         * target ('href="..." target="<target_values>">...')
           This attributes can have different values and informs the bowser how to open
           the link.

           Target values
            - nothing (default), no target set: Open in the same window
            - "_blank": Opens the link in a new tab

         * root or home ('href="/">...')
           Going to the root or home of the site. normally there should be a index.html
           at the root / home that you get redirected to and it gets loaded.
