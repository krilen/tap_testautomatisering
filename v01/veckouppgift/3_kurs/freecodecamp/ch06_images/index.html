    The image tag <img> does not have a closing tag and that is why you always should
    close it using "... />" (self-closing). HTML5 does not care about the closing but
    React cares and this will cause an error is the img tag is not closed.

    The 'src' attribute is where the image path is added.

    The 'alt' attribute is used to help "assisting" technology such as a screen reader
    to inform about the image. But the alt text also appears beside a broken image 
    on the page if the image can not be loaded and displayed.

    The 'title' attribute is used to complement the image, not used by a screen reader
    since it uses the alt attribute. When you pass over the image the title text
    appeares.

    The 'width' and 'height' if you only use one of them the image will shift to the
    new size but keep the ratio of the image. It is recommended to always supply the
    height and witdh of an image even if CSS can change the size. This to avoid the
    image shift when the content on the page is loaded. An image without its size
    will shift around the other elements if it is slow to load. But by providing 
    the real size from the begining the shigt can be avoided.

    Then there is the 'loading' attribute. This is how the image should be loaded.
    By default the value for all images loading attribute is set to "eager". 
    The other value is "lazy". This has all to do with the performance of the page.
    All images that should be seen when loading a page without scrolling an image
    be set to the default (eager) so they get loaded as soon as possible. Images 
    that are not seen (below the fold) without scrolling should be loaded after 
    and set to "lazy". This makes that the browser will only load the image when
    it knows that the image is about to be shown.

    There is an element that can contain a image as its content and that is 
    'figure'. The image is placed in the figuare tag and you can also add 
    'figcation' the content of this element tells both the browser and assisting
    technology a cation for the image. The image gets indented and the cation will 
    appear above (first) or below (last) the image. This do not need to be thesame
    as the 'alt' attribut value of the image but it should be near each other.

    <figure>
        <img ...>
        <figcation>Caption for the image</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    The figure tag can also contain HTML5 code. The HTML code needs to be
    inside a 'code' element and it can not be HTML code but only to look like code.

    <figure>
        <figcaption>An example of HTML5 code</figcaption>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
        </p>
    </figure>
