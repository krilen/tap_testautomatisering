    Semantic HTML helps to define different sections of a webpage.
    The 'nav' elemet is a semantic element to group links together for navigation on the
    page. Can be multiple 'nav' elements on a page but then the different 'nav' elements
    needs to have different 'aria-label' attribute values.
    Even 'hr' is a semantic elemet to define changes in the page, different topics.
    The 'section' element provides even mor meaning.

    Other semantic element are 'header', 'main' and 'footer' to be able to devide a 
    webpage to it components.
     * 'header': can be multiple headers but they need to follow the header hierarki.
     * 'main': Only be per page
     * 'footer': Like header there can be more than one footer.

    When staring to devide a page with 'main' there is a better way of devided it
    not with 'section' but with 'article'. The reason is that the elemet is clearly on
    its own and with 'article' we even point this out than with 'section'. The
    navigation using the section as the interal navigation still works with 'article'.
    When to use 'section' vs 'article' is not clearly defined and the debate is ongoing.
    One way to see it is that 'article' has a CLEAR topic while 'section' is more
    generic tha can be define somewhere on the page. But there is nothing stopping you
    to define 'sections' within an 'article'.

    'aside' is another semantic element that is is another complimary section of the
    page. That is is not as important as what is in the 'main' or 'article' where you
    are putting it into (related but side text to the main text).
